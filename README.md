# DecisionTree

## About the Project

I have become interested in the field of machine learning training models and its capabilities
to utilise exploratory data to deduce predictive outcomes from historical samples. 

Decision/Classification trees represent a tree-like structure that uses independent factors of a
dataset to predict outcomes upon one dependent varaible in some dataset. Each node in the tree
has a threshold which asks the decision model whether a certain feature variable is below/above 
this requirement (decision nodes), and depending on the distribution, the tree will continue to 
split feature variables until all thats left in the dataset are leaf nodes withholding target 
variable options.

## Assumptions

1. The decision tree must take in **quantitative** independent data columns.
2. The target, dependent variable is **qualitative**.
3. Datasets are in the form of a CSV file in the same directory.

## Drawbacks/Learning Aspirations

The duration of the project allowed me to understand how difficult a high accuracy rate is to 
achieve with a AI model like decision trees. It has introduced strategies such as pruning
to remove unnecessary complexity the model possesses initially, in which I intend to implement soon.
